"""
PD position tracker: turn the Single Motor by hand and watch the Double
Motor drive to match its angle. Kp and Kd sliders let you see, live, how
proportional and derivative gain change the response -- rise time,
overshoot, oscillation, settling time.

Install first:
    pip install legoeducation matplotlib
Then copy lelib.py from the "useful libraries" folder into this project's
folder (already done here).

Controller: at every loop tick,
    error   = target_position - actual_position
    speed   = Kp * error - Kd * d(actual_position)/dt
speed (clamped to +-MAX_SPEED) is the only thing being commanded -- there is
no separate position-move command, so all of the tracking behavior you see
comes from the P and D terms alone. The D term damps the follower's own
velocity (not the error's), so it damps overshoot instead of reacting to
how fast the dial is being turned by hand -- see the comment in
control_loop() for why.
